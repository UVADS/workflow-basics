# Workflow Basics

Learn how to link data engineering and data analytics tasks into scalable, reliable pipelines using modern workflow orchestration tools.

## What's a Workflow?

A workflow is a sequence of tasks executed in order with dependencies to accomplish a larger goal. We focus on **workflow orchestration tools** for data engineering and analytics that automate, schedule, and manage data processing pipelines—from simple ETL to complex ML tasks.

**We distinguish:**
- Workflows related to your Office Productivity tools (not covered here)
- Workflows for DevOps (CI/CD)
- Workflows for Data Engineering and Data Analytics
