# Workflow Basics

Learn about linking data engineering and data analytics tasks into scalable and reliable pipelines.

## What's a Workflow?

A workflow is a sequence of tasks executed in order with dependencies to accomplish a larger goal. These tutorials focus on **workflow orchestration tools** for data engineering and analytics that automate, schedule, and manage data processing pipelines—from simple ETL to complex machine learning tasks.

**We distinguish:**
- Workflows related to your Office Productivity tools (not covered here)
- Workflows for DevOps (CI/CD)
- Workflows for Data Engineering and Data Analytics
