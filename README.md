# Workflow Basics


## What's a Workflow?

We distinguish
- Workflows around your Office Productivity tools (not covered here)
- Workflows for DevOps (CI/CD)
- Workflows for Data Engineering and Data Analytics

## Setup

The General Setup section describes the steps to clone this repository, including all examples to your local computer. In addition, each Workflow orchestration tool has its own sets of software dependencies. You can find specific setup instruction under each Workflow chapter.

## Examples

The examples folder provides short scripts to get you started. They are organized in subfolders corresponding to the specific workflow orchestration tools.
